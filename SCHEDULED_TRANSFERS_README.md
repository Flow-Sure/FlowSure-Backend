# Scheduled Transfers Backend - Implementation Complete ✅

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Model** (`src/models/ScheduledTransfer.js`)
- MongoDB schema for scheduled transfers
- Fields: userAddress, title, description, recipient, amount, scheduledDate, status, retryLimit, executedAt, transactionId
- Status enum: scheduled, executing, completed, failed, cancelled
- Indexed for efficient queries

### 2. **API Routes** (`src/routes/scheduledTransfers.js`)
All 7 endpoints implemented:
- `POST /api/scheduled-transfers` - Create new scheduled transfer
- `GET /api/scheduled-transfers/user/:userAddress` - Get all user's transfers
- `GET /api/scheduled-transfers/user/:userAddress/month` - Get transfers by month
- `GET /api/scheduled-transfers/user/:userAddress/upcoming` - Get next 7 days
- `GET /api/scheduled-transfers/:id` - Get single transfer
- `PUT /api/scheduled-transfers/:id` - Update scheduled transfer
- `DELETE /api/scheduled-transfers/:id` - Cancel scheduled transfer

### 3. **Execution Service** (`src/services/scheduledTransferService.js`)
- `executeScheduledTransfer()` - Execute a single transfer
- `processDueTransfers()` - Find and execute all due transfers
- `getScheduledTransferStats()` - Get statistics
- Automatic status updates (scheduled → executing → completed/failed)
- Error handling and logging

### 4. **Cron Job** (`src/services/scheduledTransferCron.js`)
- Runs every 60 seconds (1 minute)
- Checks for due transfers
- Executes them automatically
- Singleton pattern for single instance
- Graceful start/stop

### 5. **Server Integration** (`src/app.js`)
- Routes registered at `/api/scheduled-transfers`
- Cron job starts on server startup
- Graceful shutdown handling

---

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User schedules a transfer** via frontend
   - POST request to `/api/scheduled-transfers`
   - Transfer saved with status "scheduled"

2. **Cron job runs every minute**
   - Queries for transfers where `scheduledDate <= now` and `status = 'scheduled'`
   - For each due transfer:
     - Updates status to "executing"
     - Calls `executeInsuredAction()` (with protection)
     - Updates status to "completed" or "failed"
     - Stores transaction ID

3. **User checks status** via frontend
   - Calendar shows color-coded events
   - Can view transaction details
   - Can cancel if still "scheduled"

---

## Testing

### Start the Backend:
```bash
cd FlowSure-Backend
npm install
npm start
```

You should see:
```
FlowSure backend running on port 3000
Event monitor started
Scheduler service started
Scheduled transfer cron job started (runs every minute)
```

### Test Endpoints:

#### 1. Create a Scheduled Transfer
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scheduled-transfers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userAddress": "0x123",
    "title": "Test Transfer",
    "description": "Testing scheduled transfers",
    "recipient": "0xabc",
    "amount": 10.5,
    "scheduledDate": "2025-10-20T15:00:00.000Z",
    "retryLimit": 3
  }'
```

#### 2. Get User's Transfers
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/scheduled-transfers/user/0x123
```

#### 3. Get Upcoming Transfers
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/scheduled-transfers/user/0x123/upcoming
```

#### 4. Cancel a Transfer
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/scheduled-transfers/{transferId}
```

## Cron Job Monitoring

Watch the console logs to see the cron job in action:

```
⏰ [2025-10-20T12:00:00.000Z] Running scheduled transfer check...
📅 Processing 2 due scheduled transfers...
✅ Scheduled transfer 123abc executed successfully
✅ Scheduled transfer 456def executed successfully
📊 Cron job completed: 2 successful, 0 failed
```

---

## Database Queries

The cron job uses this query to find due transfers:
```javascript
ScheduledTransfer.find({
  status: 'scheduled',
  scheduledDate: { $lte: new Date() }
})
```

Indexes ensure fast queries:
- `userAddress + scheduledDate`
- `status + scheduledDate`
- `userAddress + status`

---

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Current Limitation
The current implementation executes transfers using the existing `executeInsuredAction()` function, which creates an ActionMetric but doesn't actually send blockchain transactions.

### 🔧 For Production
You'll need to implement actual blockchain transaction execution:

1. **Option A: Service Wallet**
   - Backend holds a service wallet
   - User pre-authorizes transfers
   - Backend signs and sends transactions

2. **Option B: Smart Contract Authorization**
   - User grants permission to FlowSure contract
   - Backend calls contract to execute on user's behalf
   - See `SCHEDULED_TRANSFERS_BACKEND.md` for Cadence examples

---

## Configuration

### Cron Interval
To change the cron interval, edit `src/services/scheduledTransferCron.js`:
```javascript
this.intervalMs = 60000; // 1 minute (default)
// this.intervalMs = 30000; // 30 seconds
// this.intervalMs = 300000; // 5 minutes
```

### Validation
- Scheduled date must be in future
- Only "scheduled" transfers can be updated/cancelled
- User address validation via middleware

---

## API Response Examples

### Success Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "userAddress": "0x123",
    "title": "Monthly Salary",
    "recipient": "0xabc",
    "amount": 100,
    "scheduledDate": "2025-10-25T14:30:00.000Z",
    "status": "scheduled",
    "retryLimit": 3,
    "createdAt": "2025-10-20T12:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-10-20T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Response:
```json
{
  "error": "Scheduled date must be in the future"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend is fully implemented
2. ✅ Cron job is running
3. ✅ All API endpoints work
4. 🔄 Test with frontend
5. 🔄 Implement actual blockchain transactions (for production)
6. 🔄 Add authentication/authorization
7. 🔄 Add rate limiting per user
8. 🔄 Add email/push notifications for executed transfers

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cron job not running?
Check console for: `Scheduled transfer cron job started`

### Transfers not executing?
- Check if scheduled date is in the past
- Check transfer status is "scheduled"
- Check console logs for errors

### Database connection issues?
Ensure MongoDB is running and `.env` has correct connection string
